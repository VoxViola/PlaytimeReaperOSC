# PlaytimeReaperOSC
This is a small project built in Open Stage Control that works with Playtime 2 and Realearn in Reaper, to control clip launching, and intended to be used with an iPad. It must be paired with custom settings available for download on the projects page of my website www.trevornew.com

You'll need these things:
1. Playtime 2 downloaded https://www.helgoboss.org/projects/playtime (Reaper comes with it)
2. Reaper (https://www.reaper.fm/download.php
3. Open Stage Control installed https://openstagecontrol.ammd.net/download/ (similar to TouchOSC but server based and javascript enabled)
4. custom Realearn .json files or my example project available at www.trevornew.com/tech
5. Touch control surface (iPad, tablet, touchscreen)

This works right out of the box with Reaper and Playtime 2, and Open Stage Control properly configured and on the same network as the computer, there are many ways to do this.
1. connect to the same wifi network
2. wired ethernet betweem tablet and computer running open stage control and reaper
3. all devices connected to hotspot
4. connect via data usb cable

There are many more ways to do this but see Open Stage Control and Reaper installation instructions.
